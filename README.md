# Problem Statement

SIH25045: Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Transparency for Agricultural Produce

### Description

Create a blockchain-based system to track agricultural produce from farm to consumer, ensuring transparency in pricing, quality, and origin. The solution should allow stakeholders (farmers, distributors, retailers) to verify transactions and reduce exploitation in the supply chain.

### Expected Outcome

A decentralized platform with a user-friendly interface for farmers and consumers to trace produce, reducing fraud and ensuring fair pricing, deployable on low-cost hardware or cloud infrastructure.

### Technical Feasibility

Leverages existing blockchain frameworks like Ethereum or Hyperledger, with smart contracts for automated tracking and QR code integration for consumer access.
